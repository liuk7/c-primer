How to use the **Github** to track my study of *C++ Primer*, here are some principles:
1. Every week you should have a ToDoList first, which list the tasks you are to complete within this week:
    * Write down the ToDoList at the beginning of the week;
    * Check if you complete the daily tasks at the end of every day, and here is the example:
        - [x] Task done
        - [ ] which is not

2. After a week's study, you should write a summary about what you have learnt in this week， here is the format:
    ###Summary of week n (Chapter x)
    * **Key points**
        1. Key point 1: definition
            - Example 1 (always the code), like this
            ```
            public int Max(int a, int b)
            {
                if(a > b) return a;
                return b;
            }
            ```
            - Example 2
        2. Key point 2
            - ...
    * **New Knowledge Points（or new features）**
        1. same as above
        2. ...
    * **Tips**
        ...

3. All the source files of every chapter should be stored in the *CH_x* files folders, respectively.
