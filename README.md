How to use the **Github** to track my study of *C++ Primer*, here are some principles:

1. Every week you should have a ToDoList first, which lists the tasks you are to complete within this week:
    * Write down a ToDoList at the beginning of the week;
    * Check if you complete the daily tasks at the end of every day, and here is the example:
        - [x] Task done
        - [ ] which is not
    * Make a summary after a week.

2. After a chapter's study, you should write a summary about what you have learnt in this chapter. Here is the format:
    ### Summary of chapter n
    * **Key points**
        1. Key point 1: definition
            - Example 1 (always the code), like this
            ```C++
            public int Max(int a, int b)
            {
                if(a > b) return a;
                return b;
            }
            ```
            - Example 2
        2. Key point 2
            - ...
    * **New Knowledge Points (or new features)**
        1. same as above
        2. ...
    * **Tips**
        ...

3. All the source files of every chapter should be stored in the *CH_x* files folders, respectively.
